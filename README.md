# 🚀 Project Portfolio

This repository showcases multiple full-stack projects where the **backend is fully developed in Java** by me, demonstrating strong command over **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. The **frontend was assisted by AI** to speed up UI development and ensure a responsive, user-friendly interface. While AI generated initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript templates, all code was **reviewed, customized, and integrated manually**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The projects below highlight my hands-on experience in designing and implementing backend logic from scratch, with **95% of the backend coded entirely by myself**. AI was used solely to streamline frontend development.

## 🤖 AI Usage Disclosure

AI tools were used **only for frontend development**:

* To generate initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript layouts.
* To speed up repetitive design tasks and ensure responsive UI.

AI tools were **not used** for:

* Writing backend logic
* Designing system architecture
* Implementing core application workflows

All backend development, calculations, and logic implementations are **95% authored by me** and thoroughly tested.
